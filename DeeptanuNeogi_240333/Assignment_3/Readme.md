**Short Note on Neural Network Implementation for MNIST Classification using MATLAB**

This assignment demonstrates the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox. The solution involves:

1. **Data Loading & Visualization**: The MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images) is loaded using built-in MATLAB functions (`digitTrain4DArrayData`, `digitTest4DArrayData`), with sample images displayed for verification.

2. **CNN Architecture**: A simple yet effective CNN is designed with:
   - Two convolutional layers (3Ã—3 filters, 8 and 16 channels) with ReLU activation and batch normalization.
   - Max-pooling for dimensionality reduction.
   - A 10-unit output layer with softmax for digit classification (0-9).

3. **Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer for 5 epochs, achieving ~98% test accuracy. Results include:
   - Accuracy metrics.
   - Confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications.
   - Visualizations of predictions versus ground truth.

**Key Takeaways**:
- MATLAB's high-level tools simplify CNN implementation without compromising performance.
- Even a basic CNN achieves high accuracy on MNIST, showcasing the power of deep learning for image classification.
- The solution serves as a foundation for more complex computer vision tasks.
