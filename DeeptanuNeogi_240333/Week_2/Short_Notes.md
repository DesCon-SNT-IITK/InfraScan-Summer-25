## Title: Basic Image Processing in MATLAB

## Objective:
To apply fundamental image processing techniques on a sample image using MATLAB,e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, sharpening, histogram equalization, binarization, and labeling connected regions.

## Procedure:
i.   A sample image was loaded using MATLAB's "imread" function.

ii.  The image was resized to 256x256 pixels using "imresize".

iii. The color image was converted to grayscale using "rgb2gray".

iv.  A Gaussian blur was applied using "imgaussfilt" to reduce noise.

v.   Sharpening was applied to enhance edges using "imsharpen".

vi.  Histogram equalization was performed with "histeq" to improve contrast.

vii. The grayscale image was binarized using "imbinarize".

viii.Connected regions were labeled using "bwlabel", and the regions were visualized with "label2rgb".

## Results:
The following results were obtained:

Number of connected regions: Detected regions indicate distinct connected structures.

Visual representations of each stage are shown in the figures.

## Conclusion:
By the MATLAB code,we successfully demonstrated the application of basic image processing tasks.We are able to showcase the transformations and analysis of the sample image.
