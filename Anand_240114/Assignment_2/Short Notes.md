## Report
## Aim-:To learn how to use image processing tool 
## Procedure 
1. I had first take two images using "imread" and named as I and I2.
2. Then i resized image I using "imresize" to 256*256 dimension.
3. then i converted both images to grayscale using "im2gray".
4. Then i applied guassian blur to images using "imguassfilt".
5. Next, I sharpened both the images using "imsharpen".
6. Now , I applied histogram equalisation to both the images.
7. Then binarise the image formed in step 6.
8. Now labeled the binarised image.
9. AT last ,I saved all the images.
 ## Conclusion-: hence we have learnedto use image processing tool
