Our task is to perform basic image processing operations like resizing, conversion to grayscale, Gaussian blur, sharpening, histogram equalization, binarization, and labeling connected regions using MATLAB.
Steps of doing this:

-loading a sample image.

-Resizing it to 256x256 pixels.

-Converting to grayscale.

-Applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise.

-using image sharpening.

-histogram equalization to improve contrast.

-Binarizing the image for object-background segmentation.

-Labelling connected components to identify separate object
